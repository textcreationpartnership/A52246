            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving about the year 1678. ſet forth in Print the two Examinations of <hi>Faithful Commin</hi> and <hi>Thomas Heath,</hi> not with a deſign to exaſperate or provoke any party in Religion, but partly to lay open the Plots and Contrivances of the <hi>Romish</hi> Emiſſaries to dash Proteſtants amongſt themſelves, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly undermine that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by diviſions, which they were not able to ſubvert by a more open aſſault. It pleaſed the Learned Dr. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nalſon</hi> to publish theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations, together with few
<pb facs="tcp:101569:3"/>judicious Remarks and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of his own, under the Title of <hi>Foxes</hi> and <hi>Firebrands;</hi> and dedicate it to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> the two great Pillars of our preſent Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And finding that the Firſt Part was ſo kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the World, that the Impreſſions were ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought up, and thereby an encouragement given to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, in adding ſome more materials, in order to a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part, as upon the ſame ſubject. I have therefore for thy information cauſed the Firſt Part to be Reprinted, and a Second added to it, that ſo the Hiſtory of theſe Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical diviſions might be more compleat and abſolute. The
<pb facs="tcp:101569:3"/>Collections in this Second Part are moſt of them either out of the Memorials of that great Miniſter of State the Lord <hi>Cecil,</hi> or from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of perſons that are ſtill living, and alſo able to atteſt the truth of what is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated: I am not conſcious to my ſelf of any injury that I have done either to Religion in general, or the true ſincere Profeſſors of it, ſince neither the Reputation of the one, nor the Intereſt of the other are concerned in the evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of thoſe parties that <hi>have a form of Godlineſs, but deny the power of it in their practices.</hi> I may perhaps have diſobliged the two extreme Factions in Religion, (the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and the
<pb facs="tcp:101569:4"/>
               <hi>Puritan</hi>) by expoſing their Combinations for the ruine of that <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Faith which is by Law happily eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſetled among us: And if I have done ſo, it is becauſe I tell them the truth, and lay the ſcene of things nakedly before them; and I hope the Reader will look upon it as an argument of my candor and ſincerity, that I do not ſtudy to gratifie any party in Religion, but have rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited their prejudices upon my ſelf, by ſaying theſe things that are diſobliging to them both.</p>
            <p>The truth is, my chief aim and deſign in the whole affair is, to have our diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren diſabuſed, and to pull
<pb facs="tcp:101569:4"/>away the ſcales from their eyes, which obſtructs their proſpect into the danger of their ſeparations, to let them know that the firſt feuds of their diviſions were ſown by the Prieſts and Jeſuits, that whilſt they are carrying on the ſame deſigns of Schiſm and Separation, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing <hi>Popery,</hi> though they do not think of it; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a way for the admiſſion of that myſtery of Iniquity into the Churches of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> which coſt their fore-Fathers ſo much Blood to caſt out.</p>
            <p>If they did ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of theſe things, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident they would return to the boſom of the Church, and
<pb facs="tcp:101569:5"/>no longer endanger the ſafety of the Proteſtant Religion, by aſperſing Epiſcopacy, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling the Government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and continuing the courſe of that Separation which was begun by the Papiſts, cherished by the Separatiſts, and will in the end tend to the utter ruine both of the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> and the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> which hath already brought one good King to the Block, and was again like to shake the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Scepter</hi> of a ſecond. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God make us all-wiſe to foreſee, and to prevent our danger.</hi>

            <p>WIſe and Good Men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wont to look at, and conſider the conſequences and ends of things; where our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and ſeparations will terminate, is but too obvious; things cannot long ſtand in this poſture, our vain jangling will come to the Umpirage either of the sharpened Sword of the Law, or the terrible Law of the Sword; the one is grievous, the other intolerable, upon which Party ſoever it shall fall; for the ill influences of Religious Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels are ſuch upon the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as will oblige that for Self-preſervation, to prevent the laſt by the uſe of the firſt, and
<pb facs="tcp:101569:6"/>by timely ſeverities to obviate fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture miſeries.</p>
            <p>I have yet ſeen nothing offered by <hi>Diſſenters</hi> which will not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily increaſe, rather than cure our Diviſions; and above all, that <hi>Toleration</hi> which is ſo warmly pleaded for by thoſe <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> who pretend to give an old Anſwer to a new Sermon of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet's,</hi> is certainly the moſt intolerable. It is a Door which will let in infinite Diviſions, and Subdiviſions, Errors and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and by giving people liberty to go either to <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi> will give the lazy, profane, and Atheiſtical liberty to go to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the great dishonour of God, and the inevitable decay of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion;</hi> it will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly give the <hi>Papiſts</hi> all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb facs="tcp:101569:6"/>theſe following Papers diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; they deſire to introduce Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, upon the ruine of Proteſtant Religion; it will oblige the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrate to act againſt his own, and the publick Conſcience of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and to eſtablish Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity by a Law. For ſuch are the Doctrines and Practices of ſome Diſſenters, in the judgment of all but themſelves, and of all <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> in what they oppoſe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>I know not how they come now to unite ſo cloſe againſt the Epiſcopal Party; for I know their Breaches are incurable, and the time was when <hi>Presbytery</hi> was as much <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Independents,</hi> as <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was to the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi> and ſo of the other Sects and Schiſms, which makes ſome
<pb facs="tcp:101569:7"/>people apply that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to this Confederation, <hi>Pſal. 83.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my own particular, I know but one Remedy for theſe growing Evils, and that is, to permit the Sovereignty to lodge where God Almighty has placed it, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it for Conſcience ſake. I think the Authors of the <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Catechiſm</hi> allow his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Power to be of God; <hi>He is the Miniſter of God for our good.</hi> Now who is to be judge of the goodneſs and fitneſs of laws, Religious, Moral, or Political? ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prince or the people: If the people, then is not the King Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, contrary to St. <hi>Peter, 1 Ep. 2. cap. 13.</hi> If the King be the Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the caſe, every private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is bound to ſubmit to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb facs="tcp:101569:7"/>Conſcience, which is the Law of the Nation; which the King, with the advice, and by the conſent of the wiſdom of the Nation, has judged, and therefore eſtablished for the publick good. So that the Conteſt of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> appears to be for Empire and Sovereignty, and who shall be the Supreme Judge of the Goodneſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of Laws;<note n="*" place="margin">Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> and they do very ill to quarrel at Clergie-mens Coaches and Liveries, who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are grasping at Crowns and Scepters. And if any or many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men shall not judge theſe Laws ſo good as thoſe they would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, they ought to ſubmit, <hi>and ſtudy to be quiet,</hi> and not make the greater Duty of Mercy and Peace of the <hi>Church</hi> ſubmit to the Sacrifice of what, may be, is but

            </p>
            <p>I have a Theme before me too copious for an Epiſtle, and shall therefore, that I may not tranſgreſs the bounds of one, diſmiſs the other. I only offer theſe following diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of the <hi>Danger</hi> to which <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and theſe Nations are expoſed by <hi>obſtinate Separation,</hi> to your cool and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired thoughts, and hope you are too good men and Chriſtians to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem me</p>

                  <p>And indeed herein the Papiſts have been moſt induſtrious, and it is but juſt to fear they are ſo ſtill, to animate thoſe Separations they have created, with Principles of Hatred and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity

                        <hi>Spaniſh Armada</hi> came upon the Coaſt of <hi>England</hi> in the year 1639. where among other paſſages, diſcourſing of an Enterprize upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was then in an high Ferment of the <hi>Covenanters</hi> againſt the <hi>King, Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Common-Prayer;</hi> the <hi>Propoſer</hi> thus argues, that there could be no Fleet ſet out ſo ſtrong as to attempt them by Sea, except all the <hi>Kingdom</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to it, which, ſays he, <hi>Cannot be done except all the States joyn; of which, we of the</hi> Confederacy <hi>ſhall be the greater Part, and ſo the Enemy ſhall forthwith be forced either to give</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience <hi>to the</hi> Catholicks, <hi>or put themſelves in danger of loſing all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Obſerve firſt, The <hi>Scots</hi> had no enemies but the <hi>King,</hi> or, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, his evil Counſellors, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Stafford,</hi> who all run the ſame Fate which the Papiſts in <hi>Habnerfield</hi>'s diſcovery of their Plot had contrived for them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> was the ground of the <hi>Quarrel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They of the Confederacy were the greateſt part of <hi>the States,</hi>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:101569:32"/>but it is evident the <hi>Covenanters</hi> were the greateſt part of the States (for they had turned out the <hi>Biſhops</hi>) at that time; and if there be ſenſe in the Words, or truth in the Relation, it gives a remarkable glimpſe of Light into this dark Vault, and imports a ſecret confederacy againſt the King and Church of <hi>England,</hi> between the Papiſts and Covenanters, and that that formidable <hi>Armada</hi> was deſigned for the aſſiſtance of the Covenanters: and the next page gives not only a greater Light, but a clear vindication of the King from any ſuch complyances with the Papiſts, as were ſuggeſted, and made the foundation of the War. <hi>As for the King of</hi> Great Britain, adds he, <hi>If he will not give</hi> Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>he ſhall be reduced to it with no little damage.</hi> Now who were they that preſſed for this <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> and did reduce theſe <hi>Nations</hi> to it, all people know.

                     <p>But that which makes the thing plain, is the diſcovery which was made to Sir <hi>William Boſwell,</hi> by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas ab Habnerfield,</hi> which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated firſt by Sir <hi>William</hi> to my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and by him tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the King then at <hi>York, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemb.</hi> 1640.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101569:33"/>to effect this the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were raiſed, and fomented by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that they exaſperated the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſſenters by the ſeverity uſed againſt <hi>Pryn, Burton,</hi> and <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> by the Fears of Popery upon the Impoſition of the Common-Prayer Book; that <hi>Cuneus</hi> or <hi>Cou,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Legate, and <hi>Chamberlain</hi> a <hi>Scot,</hi> Chaplain and Almoner to <hi>Cardinal Richelieu,</hi> were the great Negotiators of this <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> and that the deſign was to embroil theſe <hi>Nations</hi> in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War. The Troubles came on ſo faſt, as may well be ſuppoſed, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated for fear of a further proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this diſcovery, that the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop</hi> loſt his Head for refuſing a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals</hi> Hat, and oppoſing the <hi>Scottiſh Covenanters;</hi> and the King this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not give away the <hi>Crown,</hi> and pull down the <hi>Mitre</hi> by granting <hi>Toleration.</hi> And however the following Diſtractions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion ſtifled the further proſecution and diſcovery of this Plot, yet the <hi>Tragical Event</hi> juſtified the Truth of the Diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:101569:34"/>What the conſequences of theſe Proceedings would have been if <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> had permitted thoſe Uſurping Powers to come to any firm Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God only knows; but a <hi>Tyranny</hi> in the Church like that of the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is moſt ſuitable and natural to the-Tyrannical and Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Rebels, Regicides, and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. But God miraculouſly reſtoring our Gracious Sovereign King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second to his Throne, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> to her priſtine Splendor, we were in a State of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility till of late years.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Papiſts</hi> envious of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, began or rather continued to leaven the diſaffected party of men in Church and State againſt both; and how far they had driven on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns for a ſecond Revolution, few people can be ſtrangers; the old Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were revived, and new ones min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to raiſe fears and jealouſies of <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> to ſet us altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Ears. The <hi>Scots</hi> were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to a Rebellion, and did actually break out into a form'd <hi>Rebellion:</hi>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:101569:34"/>the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> were buſie every where to calumniate the Biſhops and Church as Popiſhly affected, the <hi>Lawn Sleeves</hi> were threatned, and the Epiſcopal Party branded with all the names of Ignominy; ſo that the rich and wiſe Citizens of the great <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>London</hi> knew ſcarcely whether their greateſt danger was from Papiſts or Phanaticks, Wealth being always a Crime in Popular Tumults and Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections; Sedition was as commonly talked, and as hot as <hi>Coffee</hi> was drank; and in a word, from the Court to the <hi>Cottage</hi> none could eſcape the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Popiſhly affected, who durſt write or ſpeak in vindication of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or againſt Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>And that all this was but a Branch of the late horrid <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> againſt his Majeſties Life, the Government by Law eſtabliſhed, and the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> I offer the Teſtimony of Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> the firſt and principal Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer; who all along charges the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, the diſguiſed Prieſts and Jeſuits with managing the intemperate heat

                     <p>Thus in his Printed <hi>Narrative,</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph 1.

                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Paragraph</hi> 35. That the Jeſuits by order of the Provincial, were to ſend new Meſſengers into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the <hi>Commotions</hi> there, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the people of the great <hi>Tyranny</hi> they lay under by reaſon of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denied <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> and that not being to be procured but by the Sword, they muſt take that courſe to purchaſe their Liberty.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Paragraph</hi> 50. The Deponent, Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> ſaw a Letter from Father <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Auguſt</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> 1678. where, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things, he intimates the joy he had, that the diſaffected <hi>Scots</hi> would not lay aſide their endeavors for, and after <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and that the <hi>Catholicks</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> had promiſed to uſe the utmoſt of their Intereſt to keep up the Commotions there.</p>
                     <p>Here let me be permitted to make a little break to confirm this <hi>Evidence</hi> by a remarkable Paſſage which fell out the laſt year in the tragical end of the Lord <hi>Forreſler.</hi> This Lord was the perſon that after the defeat of the Rebels at <hi>Bothwel-Bridge,</hi> took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon the Indulgence granted by His Majeſty, to erect a Houſe within two miles of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for a publick <hi>Conventicle</hi> of <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> and for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101569:36"/>his building this <hi>Synagogue,</hi> went for a zealous man among them; but ſo it hapned, that not long after he was barbarouſly murdered by a Woman Relation, with whom he had inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly lived many years: After his death a <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> was found in his Cloſet from the Pope to marry her, which it ſeems he delaying to do, ſhe took his Life as the price and repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her abuſed Honour;<note place="margin">Raviliac Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divivus.</note> which plainly ſhews that theſe Supporters of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> may be, and are ſecret Papiſts.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed, <hi>Paragraph</hi> 51. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other myſterious Phraſes rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Plot, <hi>John Keins</hi> told the Deponent, that the Provincial had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken great care of keeping alive the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between the diſaffected <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Duke Lauderdale,</hi> that <hi>Mum</hi> and <hi>Chocolate</hi> ſhould be put down, and the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Magpies</hi> ſhould be turned to their primitive Inſtitution and Habit.

                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:101569:39"/>Now, as in reaſon we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Papiſts are leſs ſollicitous for their Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> than in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> ſo we cannot but conclude from this evident matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> that they have been as indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts to ſow dividing Principles, and animate them againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Governors both in Church and State.</p>
                     <p>And that this may not paſs for a bare ſuppoſition, without ground, I I have heard Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> affirm, that both <hi>Gavan</hi> and <hi>Whitebread</hi> uſed to Preach frequently in <hi>Conventicles</hi> in <hi>Southwark</hi> and other places: and I am able to prove, <hi>Whitebread,</hi> aliàs <hi>White,</hi> the Provincial of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who was executed for the Plot, did not many months before the Diſcovery, and his Apprehenſion Preach in a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle</hi> as a Nonconformiſt, at <hi>Spald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> within five miles of <hi>Huntington;</hi> and that he had ſeveral times done the like before, as was atteſted by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Congregation, before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Gentlemen in the County of

                     <p>And indeed nothing is more fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible or eaſie; for it is no more than for a Jeſuit to bring a counterfeit Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Recommendation from ſome known Nonconformiſt either out of the Town, if he deſigns to travel and Preach in the Countreys, as an <hi>Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> or out of the Countrey, if he will Preach in the Town, or a Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate that he has Preached in ſuch or ſuch Congregations, with their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, which he is ſure to have, if he inveigh againſt Popery, Biſhops, Ceremonies, Common Prayer, and for Liberty of Conſcience, and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is done, and without further Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination he is admitted into their

It hath been the
<pb facs="tcp:101569:45"/>unhappineſs of theſe Kingdoms ever ſince the Reformation to meet with brisk oppoſitions in point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, not only from profeſſed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but disguiſed Friends; and the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had no ſooner shaken off that Idolatry and Superſtition that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread and deformed the face of primitive Apoſtolical Religion; but like the woman in the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cap. 12.</note> she was perſecuted by the Dragon, who raiſed up all his Arts and Stratagems to devour that child of the Reformation which had coſt her ſo many throws and ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. The Papiſts on one hand, and the Puritans on the other, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſully and beſpatter the glory of her Reformation, the one taxing it with Innovation, and the other with Superſtition, and too

<pb facs="tcp:101569:46"/>in ſuperſtitious Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, is in effect to ſay, that they were reſolved to maintain what they had abjured, and act contrary to all the declarations that they had published to the World in their own defenſe. But it will appear far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from this diſcourſe, that theſe objections were ſuggeſted to our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters from the Papiſts, who have frequently acted and preached in the habits of diſſenters, and though they pretend to be more zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery than others, yet they are not ashamed to whet their ſwords at the forges of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, and make uſe of their arts and asſiſtance for the ruine of the <hi>Church:</hi> I wish they would but ſeriouſly reflect upon theſe things, and conſider that by inſiſting in the paths that the Papiſts have chalked

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101569:48"/>thou not that 'tis in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſpoſe of the Sword and Scepter to whom we pleaſe.

                              <p>The Bishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for the moſt part have Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned your Predeceſſors, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101569:49"/>Anointed them Kings of this Land; yet it was not in their power to receive or reject them, neither did it give them authority to preſcribe them conditions to take or to leave their Crowns, although the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon your Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, by his Bishops Act and Oil, that in the end they might poſſeſs thoſe Bishops with an Intereſt to diſpoſe of their Crowns at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But the wiſer ſort will look to their Claws, and clip them.</p>
                              <p>The Solemn Rites of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation have their ends and utility, yet neither direct force or neceſſity; they be good admonitions to put Kings in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101569:49"/>mind of their duty to God, but no encreaſement of their Dignity. For they be God's Anointed, not in reſpect of the Oil which the Bishop u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, but in conſideration of their Power which is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of the Sword which is authorized, of their Perſons which are elected by God, and endued with the gifts of his Spirit, for the better ruling and guiding of the people. The Oil, if added, is but a Ceremony; if it be wanting, that King is yet a perfect Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch notwithſtanding, and God's Anointed, as well as if he was In-oiled. Now for the Perſon or Bishop that doth Anoint a King, it is proper to be done by the chiefeſt; but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101569:50"/>if they cannot, or will not, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bishop may perform this Ceremony.</p>
                              <p>To condition with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs upon theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> (or other Bishops owning his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy) hath no authority, but he may faithfully declare what God requires at the hands of Kings and Rulers, that is Religion and Vertue. Therefore not from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but as a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, I shall moſt humbly admonish your Royal Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty what things your Highneſs is to perform. Your Majeſty is God's Vice-Gerent, and Chriſt's Vicar within your own Dominions, and to ſee
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101569:50"/>with your Predeceſſor <hi>Joſiah</hi> God truly worshipped, and Idolatry deſtroyed, the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> banished from your Subject, and Images removed. Theſe acts be ſigns of a ſecond <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who reformed the Word of God in his days. You are to reward Vertue, to revenge Sin, to juſtify the Innocent, to relieve the Poor, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Peace, to repreſs Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and to execute Juſtice throughout your Realms, for Preſidents on thoſe Kings who performed not theſe things. The old Law shews how the Lord revenged his quarrel, and on thoſe Kings who fulfilled theſe things, he poured forth his Bleſſings in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101569:51"/>abundance. For example it is written of <hi>Joſiah</hi> in the Book of the <hi>Kings</hi> thus, <hi>Like unto him there was no King before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, according to-all the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>neither after him aroſe there any like him.</hi> This was to that Prince a perpetual fame of dignity, to remain to the end of days.</p>
                              <p>Being bound by my Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to lay theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Royal Highneſs, the one as a reward, if you fulfil; the other as a judgment from God, if you neglect them.

                  <p>The covetouſneſs of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for theſe ſeveral hundred of

                     </note> Firſt their covetouſneſs cauſed them to forget God, by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting his Will and Commandments. Secondly, it hath cauſed them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the earthly pleaſures of this world, which Satan offered to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but Chriſt rejected his offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by rebuking him, and ſhewed that he cared not for the riches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; by his ſaying, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> hath not only cauſed the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> to aſſume to themſelves the Titles due to Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Kings and Princes; but above all, to aſſume the name of God to them and their Succeſſors, which, in a word, is Blaſphemy. At <hi>Paris,</hi> during my ſtay there, I improved my ſelf by ſearching the Records, and viewing the Books in that Univerſity; amongſt which, I lighted upon the Clergy of <hi>Leige,</hi> their Apology to Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> the Second, as touching the Oath of Allegiance, which he had granted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the then Emperor, <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth.

                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:101569:56"/>Who can juſtly blame a Biſhop for favouring his Lords party,<note place="margin">The Clergy of <hi>Leighs,</hi> their apology againſt Pope <hi>Puſchal</hi> the Second, <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca ann.</hi> 1105, or near that time.</note> to whom he oweth Allegiance, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by Oath to obſerve it. No man doubts but that Perjury is a grievous offence; God only ſweareth and repenteth not, becauſe wiſdom keeps the commandment of Gods Oath. But for us who often repent that we have ſworn, we are forbidden to ſwear. If a man ſwears, God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns him to perform his Oath unto the Lord, which is not unknown to thoſe that rend the Kingdom and the Prieſthood by a new Schiſm, and with their upſtart Traditions promiſe to abſolve from all ſins; ſuch as incur the crime of Perjury towards their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, never reading what God ſaid to <hi>Zedekias,</hi> (by the mouth of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> the Prophet) who had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Perjury againſt his Sovereign <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadonozor; He that hath broken the Covenant, ſhall he eſcape?</hi> Which St. <hi>Hierome</hi> expounds thus.

Some of theſe contrivances coming to my hands by the help of the Silver key, be as follow:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The people of <hi>England</hi> being much averted from their Mother-Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they have thought fit, ſounding out their inclinations how the common ſort are taken with the Liturgy in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for to offer her Grace to confirm it, with ſome things altered therein, provided that her Grace and the Council do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſame from <hi>Rome</hi> and her Coucil; which if it be denied, as we ſuppoſe it will, then theſe are
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101569:73"/>to aſperſe the Liturgy of <hi>England</hi> by all ways and conſpiracies imaginable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Licence or Diſpenſation to be granted to any of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Orders to Preach, ſpeak, or write againſt the now eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>England,</hi> amongſt other Proteſters againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> purpoſely to make <hi>England</hi> odious to them, and that they may retain their aſſiſtances promiſed them in caſe of any Princes invaſion, and the parties ſo licenced and indulged (diſpenced with) to be ſeemingly as one of them, and not to be either taxed, checkt, or excommunicated for ſo doing; and further, for the better aſſurance of the party ſo licenced and indulged, the party to change his name leaſt he be diſcovered, and to keep a quarternal correſpondence with any of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Priors, or others of the chief Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, Abbeys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At which quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal correſpondence ſhall not only give the Pope intelligence of Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal conſpiracy, but be a full aſſurance of their fidelity to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This propoſal was much debated
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101569:74"/>in the Council, which cauſed ſome of the Council to ſay, how ſhall we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, in caſe any of the parties ſo licenced flinch from us, and receive a good reward, and fall off from our correſpondency.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p>It was afterwards debated how it ſhould be ordered in caſe any of the Heretical Miniſtry of <hi>England</hi> ſhould become as they who had theſe Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and what ſhould be done in that caſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was then anſwered by the Biſhop of <hi>Mens,</hi> that that was the thing they aimed at, and that they deſired no more than ſeparation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

                  <p n="5">5.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101569:93"/>had a Jeſuit an Officer in his Army, and that his name was <hi>Ramſey,</hi> though he went under the name of Captain <hi>Right.</hi> Upon this deſcription of his Fathers <hi>Oliver</hi> grants a Warrant, and had him apprehended: His Quarters being ſearched where he lay, there was found Papers of correſpondence with that Society.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101569:93"/>he would diſcloſe ſeveral of his mad Pranks.

                  <p>He ſeveral times owned how he was in <hi>Cromwells</hi> days employed by the Pope, and by the Jeſuits, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their affairs as well in <hi>England</hi> as in <hi>Ireland;</hi> alſo how he had Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſometimes in an Independent ſhape, other times in an <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> and <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> ſhape, and had the Pope's <hi>Bull</hi>

                     <note place="margin">A notable Story of a Jeſuit, who pretended to be a Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, and to Preach by Inſpiration.</note> he became firſt Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>Caſhel,</hi> and Dean of <hi>Clonfert;</hi> the <hi>Iriſh Rebellion anno</hi> 1641 burſting out, the Papiſts (about thoſe parts of <hi>Ireland</hi>) murthered ſeveral of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and Proteſtant Miniſters; this <hi>Samuel</hi> being at that time in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, was preſerved by Providence by a Jeſuit named <hi>James Saul, alias Sall,</hi> who (before that Rebellion) had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Dean ſeveral favours, which cauſed <hi>James Saul</hi> to preſerve the Dean from being murthered for the ſpace of three months, until he could be conducted into <hi>Engliſh</hi> Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>After this eſcape the Dean ſailed into <hi>England,</hi> where he became Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to the then Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he tarried for divers years. It chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (during the Deans ſtay there, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101569:96"/>in the time of Uſurpation, when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Meetings were permitted,) that the Earls Counteſs was diſſwaded from her Principles, for to go to hear thoſe ſort of Preachers, amongſt whom there was a Shoo-maker much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his Auditory, which occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Counteſs to extol him unto the Dean, for a pious and heavenly gifted man, and often urg'd the Dean to go and hear him; who, upon ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, as alſo to comply with the Counteſs, the Dean went with her to this Meeting. At his coming thither, he obſerved the Shoomaker, and found by his words, that thoſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his went beyond his Laſt, and that he was a man of Parts. Yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though years had changed this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors Phyſiognomy, as alſo being altered by his Beard, the Dean recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected with himſelf that he had ſeen this Shoomaker before. At laſt, the Sermon being ended, the Counteſs (his great Admirer) invited him home to Dinner; after which the Dean and he fell into a Diſputation, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Shoomaker had skill in the

                     <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues, demanded of him how he came by that Science? The Shoomaker re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, by the holy Spirit. But (to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude) the Dean told him, he knew to the contrary, and that he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to know it; thereupon gave him thanks for preſerving of his life in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſaid you are Mr. <hi>Sall;</hi> and as you ſaved mine, I ſhall ſave yours. The Dean then ſpeaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Lord, and to his Counteſs, ſaid, this man ſaved my life in <hi>Ireland</hi> in the tumultuous days of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, therefore I ſhall make bold to engage to this my friend, that your Lordſhip and my Lady ſhall do him no harm, provided that he departed thence from that Shire, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the common people there any longer. This pretended Shoomaker being thus diſcovered, his Trade could no longer abſcond his Jeſuitical Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſo he craved a certain time for to depart thence; ſaying, Pray let me not go in a hurry, leſt I be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; which deſire of his was eaſily granted. In the interim he pretended
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101569:97"/>to the reſt of his followers to be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Spirit to go and teach elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, which did not a little trouble them, eſpecially the poor ſilly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who could not hold from drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of tears for the departure of ſo heavenly a man. After this warning he left <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> within three weeks. The Counteſs upon this was recalled to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to the great admiration of the reſt of this Impoſtors Followers, who enquiring the reaſons of this ſudden change, were all likewiſe aſhamed that they had been thus deluded.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101569:99"/>under ſeveral names, to aſſume what Function or Calling he pleaſed.

This <hi>Nowland</hi> chanced to come to one Mr. <hi>Hughs</hi> his Houſe, who was in thoſe days a great Independant Miniſter, and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher in that Town. This Miniſter hired <hi>Nowland,</hi> who at firſt was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant to the Gardner, and in little time became chief Gardner himſelf. Mr. <hi>Hughs,</hi> according to the uſual cuſtom of Diſſenters, had his weekly Meetings upon week days; where at
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101569:99"/>his Houſe the Elders and ſeveral of his Flock would aſſemble to Pray, and to Expound. It was obſerved that <hi>Now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was very diligent, and would turn to the Texts of Scripture very readily, which Mr. <hi>Hughs</hi> perceiving, encouraged <hi>Nowland,</hi> and in a ſhort time took him from Gardning, and made him his Butler. <hi>Nowland</hi> being thus highly preferr'd, ſtrove all he could to pleaſe his Maſter, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that his Maſter would ſit up late at his Study, which Study was a little beyond the Buttery, and that his Maſter was always to paſs by the Buttery-door to go thither, he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the matter thus; One night hearing his Maſter locking of his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-door, <hi>Nowland</hi> fell to his Prayers, and had put out the Candle, which Mr. <hi>Hughs</hi> hearing, he put out his Candle alſo, and laid his ear to the ſquare hole that was cut in the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery-door, where he continued whilſt <hi>Nowland</hi> was at his Prayers; after which he ſecretly went to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, conſidering with himſelf, that this poor ignorant man (as he thought)
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101569:100"/>muſt needs be inſpired. But upon the next Meeting day, Mr. <hi>Hughs</hi> diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the Elders, and chief of his Followers of this paſſage, they all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that <hi>Nowland</hi> ſhould Pray. But <hi>Nowland</hi> pretended, alas, he knew not how to Pray, poor man, not he; but it being conſented amongſt the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that he muſt Pray, and that if God had endued him with ſuch a Gift, he ſinned if he did not make uſe of it. Upon which intreaty <hi>Nowland</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, acting the geſtures, poſture and tone as well as the beſt of themſelves, to their great admiration; for which all the Meeters gave <hi>Nowland</hi> a ſumm of Money to buy him handſom Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel for thoſe days: <hi>Nowland</hi> coming every day more into favour than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he was; he begun to ſhew his Maſter ſome obſervations that he had made upon the Scripture, which ſo pleaſed the Elders, and the people, that <hi>Nowland</hi> became an Expoſitor of the Scripture, and ſo Expounded upon certain days amongſt the Meeters, and was no longer Butler, but ordered to ſit at Mr. <hi>Hughs</hi> his Table. Thus
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101569:100"/>

                  <p>Thus far have we laid before you the practices of <hi>Rome,</hi> deviſed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Proteſtant Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> therefore the diſpenſations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by her Popes and Clergy be many and large (as appears by what you have already heard) purpoſely to drive on, and ſet forward her impious Plots; ſhe therefore diſpenſes with her Adherents to take the ſhape, yea, even of a member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not out of love thereunto, but to accompliſh her intended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. For example-ſake, there was a certain Knight, Sir <hi>E.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101569:102"/>
                     <hi>Ireland anno</hi> 1670, or thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>It is not unknown unto the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants and Citizens of <hi>Dublin,</hi> that in the year following 1671, upon the one and twentieth of <hi>May</hi> there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a ſurious fire in his Majeſties Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Dublin;</hi> during which flames the Lord <hi>John Butler</hi> (afterwards created Earl of <hi>Gowran,</hi> third Son to his Grace <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> now Lord Lieutenant of the Nation) took great care and pains to extinguiſh the ſame; which had it been truſted unto the ſaid Knight, we queſtion whether half the Buildings now there extant would have been ſeen this day: For this Knight, under the pretence of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reſt of the Buildings within that Caſtle, would have blown up the great Hall belonging to this Palace. To execute this project the quicker, he cauſed a Barrel of Gunpowder to be placed in the middle of that Hall, and ſo to have dropt a train of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to ſet fire to the ſame. But this brave ſpirited Lord coming in at that inſtant, and enquiring why that Barrel was there placed, and having
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101569:103"/>heard the project, he moſt couragiouſly (although the flames were over his head) lifted up the Barrel of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, and carried it out on his ſhoulders, ſaying, <hi>I approve not of this project.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When this Fire hapned, as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reported by ſeveral of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Dublin,</hi> that night the water of the City was ſtopt, ſo that the Caſtle-pipe had no water but what they were fain to bring in from the <hi>Mill-pond</hi> in the <hi>Stable-yard</hi> without the <hi>Caſtle-walls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hath been generally reported that this Knight went ſecretly to <hi>Maſs</hi> at this time, but whether he did or no, it was obſerved that he would walk before the then Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant amongſt the Gentry to Church, with his Bible publickly under his arm to be ſeen. This poſture diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Religion, which ſince is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, although at Church he would ſeem very zealous, turning to the Texts of Scripture as faſt as they were quoted by the Miniſter.</p>

                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:101569:103"/>There is a Learned Doctor,<note place="margin">Doctor <hi>Salls</hi> teſtimony concerning this Knight.</note> ſome years now paſt, who turned unto the Church of <hi>England, Andrew Sall</hi> by name, formerly an Eccleſiaſtick of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hath affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med how he had heard formerly, when the Lord <hi>J.

                  <p>This Knight was to give intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the <hi>French</hi> King,<note place="margin">The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>French</hi> King and this Knight.</note> acting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand for him, making this Proviſo for himſelf, that in caſe he ſhould be diſcovered, and thereby incur the King of <hi>Englands</hi> diſpleaſure, if he fled into <hi>France,</hi> he ſhould be there ſuccoured, and the <hi>French</hi> King there to provide a place for him.</p>
                  <p>Several others beſides this Divine have heard the ſame, beſides what the Letters of News have mentioned to this effect. For the perfecting of this Covenant, it is viſible and known how he hath been accuſed to be one of the Conſpirators in the late Popiſh
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101569:104"/>Plot <hi>anno</hi> 1678, for which he was clapt up; but afterwards being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed upon Bail, he fled into <hi>France,</hi> where he is not only ſuccoured to this day, but likewiſe provided for, and there preferred to be an Abbot in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> where ſeveral of his Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have ſeen him ranting with his Coach and Horſes.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt this Knight tarried in <hi>Ireland</hi> to find out the affairs of the <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> of this Kingdom,<note place="margin">How this Knight thruſt out Sir <hi>William Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies</hi> to bring in himſelf Recorder of this City.</note> he cajoled ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Aldermen and Citizens of <hi>Dublin,</hi> by breeding animoſities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Recorder, Sir <hi>William Davies,</hi> purpoſely to make place for himſelf, and to expulſe Sir <hi>William.</hi> This Knight being ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, not only to know the modes and manners of the City, but alſo to change the ancient Rules and cuſtoms accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his fancy. To further this his purpoſe, he made the Lord <hi>Berkley</hi> to procure the Recorders Place, which Place he once taking poſſeſſion of, he began to change the old Rules and Cuſtoms aforeſaid, which bred much claſhing amongſt the Aldermen and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101569:104"/>Commons of the City; but he then having the ear of the Lord <hi>Berkley,</hi> bore all afore him, hectoring after this manner.</p>
                  <p>Several of the Aldermen being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with theſe actions of his,<note place="margin">His firſt pranks after he became Recorder.</note> complained, but all to no purpoſe; for which complaint of theirs, by this Knights means, and by the new ſtamp which he had raiſed to aſſiſt him, theſe Aldermen whoſe names follow were expulſed, and razed out of the roul of Aldermen; Alderman <hi>Richard Tigh, Daniel Hutchinſon, Lewis Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minieres, Enoch Reader, Mark Quin, Joſhua Allen,</hi> and <hi>Francis Bruſter,</hi> the two laſt Aldermen being ſince Knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101569:105"/>others were offered at the ſame time to be made Aldermen alſo, but refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

                  </p>
                  <p>This Honourable Peer was ſcarce fetled in the Lieutenancy when the grievances of theſe mutations (which we have already mentioned) came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Lordſhip and this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Board,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and the Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict in this matter; the ſeven Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the three degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> ſhewing before them the former paſſages and enormities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by this Knight, and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents: Theſe Grievances took up ten or eleven hours debate upon hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame. Then after ſome days conſiderations between this Noble Peer and the Privy Council, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day for the Lord Mayor, Sheriffs and Aldermen to hear their Judgment and Opinion: At which time it was ordered Sir <hi>Ellis</hi> to be expulſed, and Sir <hi>William</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; the ſeven aforeſaid Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101569:105"/>to take their places as formerly, and the other three new ones to be degraded. Upon this Order the Knight being thus deprived of his prey, fled to ſeek it elſewhere, being too well known in this City for to tarry lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſo departed hence into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                  <p>Whereas you have read already how it was the Jeſuits, and other the Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> who contrived the cutting off the two Pillars of our Church and State, the better for their evil purpoſes to contrive a way for to murther our late Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and Godly Martyr <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt.

                        <p>You muſt know the Council is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to aſſiſt the King by way of Prerogative, in caſe the Parliamentary way ſhould fail. You ſhall ſee this Parliament will reſemble the <hi>Pelican,</hi> which takes a pleaſure to dig out with her beak her own bowels.</p>
                        <p>The Election of Knights and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes have been in ſuch confuſion of apparent Faction, as that which we were wont to procure heretofore with much art and induſtry, (when the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match was in Treaty) now breaks out naturally as a Botch or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101569:106"/>Boil, and ſpits and ſpues out its own rankor and venom.</p>
                        <p>You remember how that famous and immortal Stateſman the Count of <hi>Gondomar</hi> fed King <hi>James</hi> his fancy, and rocked him aſleep with the ſoft ſweet ſound of Peace, to keep up the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Treaty. Likewiſe we were much bound to ſome Stateſmen of our own Countrey, for gaining time by procuring thoſe moſt advantagious ceſſations of Arms in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and advancing the Honour and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation, and vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> remonſtrating to King <hi>James,</hi> that that State was moſt ungrateful both to his Predeceſſor Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and his Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; that the States were more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious than the <hi>Turk,</hi> and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally injured his Majeſties loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and likewiſe they have uſurped from his Majeſty the Regality and unvaluable profit of the <hi>Narrow Seas</hi> in fiſhing upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This great Stateſman had but one principal means to further their great
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101569:107"/>and good deſigns, which was to ſet on King <hi>James,</hi> that none but the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan Faction,</hi> which plotted nothing but <hi>Anarchy,</hi> and his confuſion, were averſe to this moſt happy Union. We ſteered on the ſame courſe, and have made great uſe of this <hi>Anarchical</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and have prejudicated and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated the Great one, that none but the Kings Enemies, and his, are choſen of this Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have now many ſtrings to our Bow, and have ſtrongly fortified our Faction, and have added two Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks more: For when King <hi>James</hi> lived (you know) he was very violent againſt <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and interrupted (with his peſtilent Wit, and deep Learning) our ſtrong deſigns in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and was a great friend to that old Rebel and Heretick the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now we have planted that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Drug <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> which we hope will purge the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from their Hereſie; and it flouriſheth, and bears fruit in due ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p>The materials which build up our
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:101569:107"/>Bulwark, are the Projectors and Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars of all Ranks and Qualities: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, both theſe Factions co-operate to deſtroy the Parliament, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a new ſpecies and form of Government, which is <hi>Oligarchy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thoſe ſerve as direct <hi>Mediums</hi> and <hi>Inſtruments</hi> to our end, which is the univerſal Catholick <hi>Monarchy.</hi> Our foundation muſt be Mutation, and Mutation will cauſe a Relaxation, which will ſerve as ſo many violent Diſeaſes, as the <hi>Stone, Gout, &amp;c.</hi> to the ſpeedy diſtraction of our perpetual and inſufferable anguiſh of body, which is worſe than death it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>We proceed now by Councel and mature deliberation, how and when to work upon the Dukes jealouſie and revenge; and in this we give the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to thoſe which merit it, which are the <hi>Church Catholicks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is another matter of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which we take much into our conſideration and tender care, which is to ſtave off <hi>Puritans,</hi> that they hang not in the Dukes ears, they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent ſubtil people.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="122" facs="tcp:101569:108"/>And it is to be feared leſt they ſhould negotiate a Reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Duke and the Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> but now we aſſure our ſelves we have ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the matter, that both Duke and Parliament are irreconcilable.</p>
                        <p>For the better prevention of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> the <hi>Arminians</hi> have already lock'd up the Dukes ears; and we have thoſe of our own Religion, which ſtand continually at the Dukes Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to ſee who goes in and out: We cannot be too circumſpect and careful in this regard. I cannot chooſe but laugh to ſee how ſome of our own Coat have accoutred themſelves, you would ſcarce know them if you ſaw them: And 'tis admirable, how in ſpeech and geſture they act the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi> The <hi>Cambridge</hi> Scholars, to their woſul experience, ſhall ſee we can act the <hi>Puritans</hi> a little better than they have done the Jeſuits: They have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed our Sacred Patron, Saint <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> in jeſt; but we will make them ſmart for it in earneſt. I hope you will excuſe my merry digreſſion; for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101569:108"/>unto you, I am at this time tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with joy to ſee how happily all inſtruments and means, as well great as leſs, co-operate unto our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. But to return unto the main Fabrick; our Foundation is <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm,</hi> the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Projectors,</hi> as it appears in the premiſſes, affect mutation. This we ſecond, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force by probable arguments. In the firſt place we take into conſideration the Kings Honour, and preſent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; and we ſhew how the King may free himſelf of his Ward, as <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh did. And for his great ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and luſtre, he may raiſe a vaſt Revenue, and not be beholden to his Subjects, which is by way of impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Exciſe: Then our Church Catholicks proceed to ſhew the means how to ſettle this Exciſe, which muſt be by a Mercenary Army of Horſe and Foot. For the Horſe, we have made that ſure, they ſhall be For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, and <hi>Germans,</hi> who will eat up the Kings Revenues, and ſpoil the Countrey whereſoever they come, though they ſhould be well paid; what

                        <p>We are provident and careful that this Mercinary Army of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, and twenty thouſand Foot, ſhall be taken on, and in pay, before the Exciſe be ſetled. In form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Exciſe, the Countrey is moſt likely to riſe: If the Mercenary Army ſubjugate the Countrey, then the Souldiers and Projectors ſhall be paid out of the confiſcations; if the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey be too hard for the Souldiers, then they muſt conſequently mutiny, which is equally advantageous unto us. Our ſuperlative deſign is, to work the Proteſtants as well as the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks to welcome in a Conqueror, and that is by this means: We hope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to diſſolve Trade, and hinder the building of Shipping, in deviſing probable deſigns, and putting on the State upon Expeditions, as that of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz</hi> was, in taking away the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships, ſo that they may not eaſily catch, and light upon the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Fleet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Nay, ſaid the other, there may be hope of his life, the Chirurgion ſaid ſo. It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (he replied) I had the force of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men, aſſiſted by him that guided my hand. And being interrogated to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101569:115"/>ſeveral queſtions, he made theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers: That he was named <hi>John Felton,</hi> heretofore Lieutenant to a Foot-Company under Sir <hi>James Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey.</hi> That he had endeavoured for a Commiſſion to be Captain in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and failed therein, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regret upon the Duke, (from whom he had found reſpect) nor for any private intereſt whatſoever; that the late Remonſtrance of Parliament publiſhed the Duke ſo odious, that he appeared to him deſerving death, which no Juſtice durſt execute. That it was not many days ſince he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to kill him; but finding the Duke ſo cloſely attended, that it ſhould be his buſineſs to paſs a Voluntier, and do it in this Voyage. Somewhat he ſaid of a Sermon at St. <hi>Faiths Church</hi> under <hi>Pauls,</hi> where the Preacher ſpake in juſtification of every man in a good cauſe to be Judge and Executioner of Sin, which he interpreted to be him. That paſſing out at the <hi>Poſtern-Gate</hi> upon <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> he eſpied that fatal Knife in a Cutlers Glaſs-caſe, which he bought for ſixteen pence. It was
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101569:116"/>the point end of a tuff Blade ſtuck into a croſs Haft; the whole length, handle and all, not twelve inches, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his right pocket; and from that time he reſolved therewith to ſtab him. That ſome days after he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Train to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and coming by a Croſs erected in the High-way, he ſharpned the point thereof upon the Stone, believing it more proper in Juſtice to advantage his deſign, than for the Idolatrous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it was firſt erected.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1652. There chanced to come unto Collonel <hi>Richard Lawrence,</hi> then Governour of <hi>Waterford</hi> under <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> one <hi>Nugent,</hi> who ſeemed to be a fair conditioned man, and ſo was hired by the Collonel to work in his Garden; but knowing the Collonels temper and Principles in Religion, he ſtrove to pleaſe him all he could, not miſſing Prayers in the Family or Meetings when-ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Thus he continued with the Collonel for ſeveral years: At laſt it chanced that Juſtice <hi>John Cook,</hi> who was executed for the late Kings Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, took a great liking to this <hi>Nugent,</hi> and begged of the Collonel for to let him go over with him into <hi>England,</hi> which the Collonel eaſily granted to oblige Juſtice <hi>Cooke.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101569:117"/>Maſter Collonel <hi>Lawrence,</hi> where he remained for a while, and upon the Kings happy Reſtauration this <hi>Nugent</hi> became the Popiſh Confeſſor and Prieſt at <hi>Leiſlepp</hi> ſome 6 or 7 miles diſtant from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and hath ſeen the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel ſeveral times ſince, and laughs at him to this day when he ſees him, conſidering how he had plaid the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler with him, as if he had been one of the Collonels Fraternity, which is of the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> Thus it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent how Diſſenters have been migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily gull'd ſince the years 1640, and 1641. eſpecially by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> purpoſely to make Separation in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This the Collonel himſelf cannot deny; for he told the Author this Story on the <hi>28th.</hi> day of <hi>March</hi> 1682. beſides to others yet living in the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who can teſtifie this Narrative for a truth.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we have ſhewed how the Papiſts have acted under the diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed habits of Presbyterians and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants, with a deſign to ruine the
